# Abstract

As object detection has gained popularity in recent years, there are many object detection algorithms available in today's world. Yet the algorithm with better accuracy and better speed is considered vital for critical applications. Therefore, in this article, the use of the YOLOV4 object detection algorithm is combined with improved and efficient inference methods. The YOLOV4 state-of-the-art algorithm is 12% faster compared to its previous version, YOLOV3, and twice as faster compared to the EfficientDet algorithm in the Tesla V100 GPU. However, the algorithm has lacked performance on an average machine and on single-board machines like Jetson Nano and Jetson TX2. In this research, we examine the performance of inferencing in several frameworks and propose a framework that effectively uses hardware to optimize the network while consuming less than 30% of the hardware of other frameworks.
